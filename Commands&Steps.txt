Do all steps in the main directory of our project:

1. download npm and truffle framework:

npm install -g truffle

2. initialize truffle:

init truffle

3. migrate:

truffle migrate --reset

4. deploy:
truffle exec scripts/deploy.js --network development

4. take the address displayed on cmd and replace it in the app.js code:

once done save the changes of app.js code and now shift to the client directory:

5. cd client

6. run the app:

npm run start


Now after that you will have all the app running and contract deployed to ganache and truffle

create a static project in ganache in order to always view from it and not to change address of metamask wallets always.

Now you can see transactions of uploaded documents on the ganache transactions.


To add a wallet with funds to metamask add a network connected to ganache port and url which is localhost and use it.
